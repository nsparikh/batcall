batcall
=======

BatCall is a lightweight, streamlined Android app that allows users to send their current location to their friends. This application uses Google Accounts for authentication, so anyone with a Google Account (not just Gmail) can sign up within seconds. Upon launch, BatCall displays the user's current location and, using the Google Places API, a list of nearby places from which the user can choose a place to send to his/her friends. 

Coming soon to the Play Store.
