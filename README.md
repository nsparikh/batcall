batcall
=======

BatCall is a lightweight, streamlined Android app that allows users to send their current location to their friends. This application uses Google Accounts for authentication, so anyone with a Google Account (not just Gmail) can sign up within seconds. Upon launch, BatCall displays the user's current location and, using the Google Places API, a list of nearby places from which the user can choose a place to send to his/her friends. After selecting a place or address, the user can choose one or more contacts to which to send a message. Recipients with the application installed on their phones will receive the message as a BatCall notification in the notifications menu; clicking the notification will bring up the sender's location in the Maps application. Other recipients may receive the message as a standard text message.

Coming soon to the Play Store.
